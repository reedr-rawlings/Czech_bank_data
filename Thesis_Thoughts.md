# Thesis Thoughts

## What I learned
1. Extends are way more useful than I thought.
2. Creating action from analysis is fluid and functional.
3. Customization with HTML is rad.
4. Looker does too much for a single analyst.
5. Filtered measures are hot.
6. Comment your code.

## What bugs me/Difficulties
1. Extends are incredibly confusing as you add more layers
2. HTML is a jank way to add flexibility to visualizations.
3. Finding a focus area for analysis.
4. A more recent data set (filters).
5. Looker offers a ton of solutions, but I have no idea which one is the best.

## Feature Requests
1. Dimensionalize a measure
2. So many content requests

## If I had more time
1. Analyzed comparative metrics between regions/customers.
2. Better analysis by groups.

## Shout-outs
- TJ & Andrew for helping me troubleshoot why filters can increase values.
- Sarah for covering a bunch of my chat shifts.
- Zam for first round mentorship.
- Paola "k ur welcome".
- Dr. Mirsad Hadzikadic for running an analysis over this dataset.
