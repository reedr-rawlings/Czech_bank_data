# Thesis Thoughts



## What I learned
1. Extends are way more useful than I thought.
2. Creating action from analysis is fluid and functional.
3. Customization with HTML is rad.
4. Looker does too much for a single analyst.
5. Filtered measures are hot.

## What bugs me/Difficulties
1. Extends are incredibly confusing as you add more layers
2. HTML is a jank way to add flexibility to visualizations. We already ask folks to learn LookML
3. Finding a focus area for analysis.
4. A more recent data set (filters).

## Feature Requests
1. Dimensionalize a measure
2. So many content requests

## If I had more time
1. Analyzed comparative metrics between banks.
2. Better analyze by groups.
